## About

RPG-Core is nothing more than a small personal RPG project. My current plan is, to have a barebone core module (this module), which can be used as a foundation to create a RPG minigame as a discord bot.

It currently features some typical RPG-elements:

 - Attribute-System (eg. HP, ATK, DEF)
 - Dungeon-System (with individual stages and enemies)
 - Loot-System (fixed or randomized)
 - Item- / Inventory-System (including crafting)
 - Character-System (with equipment, level, skillpoints etc.)

But keep in mind, that these system implementations are very barebone to allow for individual customization. Also, no actual **content** is provided.

## Installation

npm: `npm install @bakuenjin/rpg-core`

yarn (recommended): `yarn add @bakuenjin/rpg-core`

RPG-Core comes with type definitions out of the box, so no additional types package needs to be installed.
